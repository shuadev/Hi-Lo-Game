# Hi-Lo-Game
A Higher Lower Guessing Game in Python

A Python-based command-line game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number. The program provides feedback after each guess, telling the user if their guess is too high or too low. The player can choose between an "easy" or "hard" level, which determines the number of guesses they get.

## Introduction

In this Hi-Lo Number Guessing game, the computer randomly generates a number, and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the computer will tell the player if their guess is too high or too low. The game can be played in either "easy" or "hard" mode, where the number of guesses allowed varies (5 for easy, 10 for hard). 

## Installation

To play the Higher Lower Guessing Game, you need Python installed on your machine. If you don't have it yet, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shuadev/hi-lo-game.git
   cd hi-lo-game
   ```

2. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```


## How to Play

1. Start the game by running the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. The game will ask you to choose a difficulty:
   - Easy mode: 5 guesses
   - Hard mode: 10 guesses

3. The program will generate a random number within a given range (between 1 and 100), and your task is to guess it.
4. After each guess, the program will tell you if your guess is "too high" or "too low."
5. You will continue guessing until you either guess the number correctly or run out of guesses.

## Game Rules

- At the beginning of the game, the player selects a difficulty:
  - **Easy**: You get 5 guesses.
  - **Hard**: You get 10 guesses.
- A random number between 1 and 100 is generated by the program.
- After each guess, the program will provide feedback:
  - If the guess is too high, you will be told "too high."
  - If the guess is too low, you will be told "too low."
- If you guess the correct number within the allowed number of guesses, you win!
- If you run out of guesses, the game ends, and you will be asked if you want to play again.
